# Clean Code Training Assignments (C# version)

This repository contains assignments for Clean Code training.

## General Task Guidelines

*    Please make corrections per the principles/topics discussed so far in this course.
*    The task repository may contain one or more than one practical task per given topic, you are expected to complete all the tasks.
*    Tasks are Java based and it is NOT mandatory to use the latest language versions while making code updates, but you are able to change language version.
*    It is recommended that you complete the practical tasks for a topic before proceeding to the next topics.
*    A task/subtopic will be considered as complete after all the review comments are incorporated from the below mentioned review process.
*    While making changes, any files contained inside package named as 'thirdparty' should be ignored. These file are meant to provide context to the task and are not part of the task.
*    Some tasks have unit tests implemented, if they exist, they are comprehensive and we are free to change production code in any way until tests are green. You may add more tests if you feel appropriate but this is not expected.

## Assignments

Find the details of the assignments in the respective folders (maven modules) in this repository.

* **Naming**
    * Analyze the code and make changes to improve the readability and maintainability by using appropriate names.
* **Comments**
    * Analyze the code and optimize the usage of comments as discussed in the training.
* **DRY**
    * Analyze the code and resolve violations of DRY rule.
* **Functions**
    * Analyze the code and make changes to improve the readability and maintainability by extracting and modifying functions.
    * NOTE: All changes can be done without creating new functional classes (Exception class is not a functional class of course). There are simple ways of completing tasks. Find them.
    * For Task 3: This task is NOT about side effects. There is considered that it's ok to have side effect for function "login", but there are other violations of clean code principles. Please find them and fix.


### Solutions
